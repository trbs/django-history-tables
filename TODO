- Cleanup
- Create setup.py
- Check it works on >django-1.0
- Add (correct) transaction protection around database access
- Write admin support for history tables
- Automatically register pre_save hooks/magic
- Use more django-like syntax, eg: History.site.register(SomeModel) ?
  though we still want to have (at the very least optionally) an explicitly
  declarated model which is the history table for SomeModel.

- Do we need to look at foreignkeys/manytomany/relational fields ?
  For instance, that we need to explicitly hook them onto (or only support?)
  the history table for that relation. Because the orgininal relation can
  (and should be able to) disappear while not having to cascade delete the
  item in the history table.

- Support migrations (South/dbmigrations/et al)
